# üéØ Pre-Planning Targeting System - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## ‚úÖ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The targeting system has been fully implemented, replacing the previous execution-time targeting with a **strategic pre-planning approach**. Players can now assign targets to cards during battlefield placement, creating a more tactical gameplay experience.

## üîß COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. **Card Selection System** ‚úÖ
- **Click Detection**: Cards can be clicked to select them for targeting
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected cards show yellow border and pulsing effect
- **Selection Management**: Only one card can be selected at a time
- **Double-Click Behavior**: Clicking selected card again moves it to battlefield

### 2. **Enemy Targeting System** ‚úÖ
- **Mouse Input Fixed**: Enemies now have proper `mouse_filter` setup
- **Click Detection**: `_on_enemy_clicked()` function handles target assignment
- **Child Filter Recursion**: All child controls properly pass mouse events
- **Visual Feedback**: Enemies glow when assigned as targets

### 3. **Targeting Line System** ‚úÖ
- **Dynamic Line**: Yellow targeting line follows mouse cursor
- **Visual Clarity**: Line connects selected card to mouse position
- **Z-Index Management**: Line appears above all other elements
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Line automatically removed when selection cleared

### 4. **Target Assignment & Storage** ‚úÖ
- **Card-Enemy Mapping**: `card_targets` dictionary stores assignments
- **Assignment Feedback**: Cards show target name labels
- **Enemy Feedback**: Enemies show glow effect when assigned
- **Persistent Storage**: Targets saved until cards are executed

### 5. **Enhanced Execution System** ‚úÖ
- **Pre-Assigned Targets**: Cards use their assigned targets during execution
- **Fallback Logic**: Random target selection if no target assigned
- **Alive Enemy Filtering**: `get_alive_enemies()` ensures valid targets
- **Sequential Execution**: Cards still execute left-to-right with delays

### 6. **Input Management** ‚úÖ
- **Right-Click Cancellation**: Right-click clears card selection
- **Mouse Motion Tracking**: Targeting line updates in real-time
- **Event Handling**: Proper `_input()` function manages global events
- **Input Validation**: Only processes relevant input events

## üîç CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### **Enemy Mouse Input** - FIXED ‚úÖ
```gdscript
# In Enemy.gd _ready():
mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_PASS
setup_mouse_filters()  # Recursive child filter setup

# Ensures all child controls pass mouse events to enemy
```

### **Variable Initialization** - FIXED ‚úÖ
```gdscript
# In Enemy.gd:
var original_scale: Vector2  # Properly declared
original_scale = scale       # Initialized in _ready()
```

### **Mouse Filter Recursion** - FIXED ‚úÖ
```gdscript
# Ensures child Label, Panel, etc. don't block mouse input
func setup_child_mouse_filters(node):
    for child in node.get_children():
        if child is Control:
            child.mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE
```

## üéÆ HOW TO USE THE TARGETING SYSTEM

### **Step 1: Select Card**
1. Click any card in your hand
2. Card shows yellow border and starts pulsing
3. Yellow targeting line appears from card to mouse cursor

### **Step 2: Assign Target**
1. Move mouse over desired enemy
2. Click the enemy to assign as target
3. Enemy glows and card shows target name label
4. Selection automatically cleared

### **Step 3: Multiple Assignments**
1. Repeat process for other cards
2. Each card can have different target
3. Cards without targets will attack randomly

### **Step 4: Execute Turn**
1. Click "End Turn" button
2. Cards execute left-to-right with their assigned targets
3. Unassigned cards attack random alive enemies

### **Cancellation**
- **Right-click anywhere**: Clears current card selection
- **Click selected card again**: Moves card to battlefield without target

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### **Basic Functionality** üéØ
- [ ] Cards can be clicked and show selection visual feedback
- [ ] Targeting line appears and follows mouse cursor
- [ ] Enemies can be clicked when card is selected
- [ ] Target assignment creates visual feedback on both card and enemy
- [ ] Right-click cancels card selection
- [ ] Multiple cards can be assigned different targets

### **Edge Cases** üî¨
- [ ] Clicking same card twice moves it to battlefield
- [ ] Cards without assigned targets attack randomly
- [ ] System handles defeated enemies properly
- [ ] Targeting line cleanup works correctly
- [ ] Selection cleared when card moved to battlefield

### **Integration** ‚öôÔ∏è
- [ ] End Turn button works correctly
- [ ] Cards execute with correct targets during turn
- [ ] Battlefield placement still works normally
- [ ] Visual effects don't interfere with targeting
- [ ] Game state properly managed throughout

## üìÅ MODIFIED FILES

### **Main.gd** - Core targeting logic
- Added card selection and targeting line management
- Enhanced `_on_card_played()` for selection workflow
- Modified `execute_card_with_delay()` for pre-assigned targets
- Added `_input()` for global mouse and keyboard handling

### **Card.gd** - Selection visual feedback
- Added `show_selected_for_targeting()` with yellow border and pulse
- Added `hide_selected_for_targeting()` for cleanup
- Added `show_target_assigned_feedback()` for target labels

### **Enemy.gd** - Mouse input and target feedback
- Fixed mouse input with proper filter setup
- Added `show_target_assigned_effect()` for glow feedback
- Enhanced mouse filter recursion for all child controls
- Fixed `original_scale` initialization

## üöÄ READY FOR TESTING

The targeting system is now **complete and ready for full testing**. All compilation errors have been resolved, mouse input issues have been fixed, and the strategic pre-planning gameplay is fully implemented.

**Launch the game and enjoy the enhanced tactical card battle experience!** üéÆ‚ú®
