# 🎯 Enhanced Pre-Planning Targeting System - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The enhanced targeting system has been **fully implemented** with all critical issues resolved and new features added. Players now have a comprehensive strategic targeting experience with automatic battlefield placement and flexible target management.

## 🔧 COMPLETED FIXES & ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. **Fixed Critical Compilation Error** ✅
- **Issue**: `expand_tween` undefined variable error in Card.gd `_on_gui_input` method
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate callback line and properly scoped tween variables
- **Result**: All scripts now compile without errors

### 2. **Enhanced Enemy Click Handling** ✅
- **Issue**: Enemy signal connection problems with `.bind()` syntax
- **Fix**: Changed to lambda function syntax: `func(event): _on_enemy_clicked(enemy, event)`
- **Result**: Enemy clicks now properly detected and processed

### 3. **Automatic Battlefield Placement** ✅
- **Enhancement**: Cards automatically move to battlefield after target assignment
- **Implementation**: Modified `_on_enemy_clicked` to call `move_card_to_battlefield` after assignment
- **Benefit**: Streamlined workflow - assign target → auto-move to battlefield

### 4. **Battlefield Card Interaction System** ✅
- **Feature**: Cards on battlefield can be clicked to change their targets
- **Implementation**: Added `_on_battlefield_card_clicked` handler
- **Workflow**: Click battlefield card → select for targeting → click enemy → target changed

### 5. **Right-Click Battlefield Removal** ✅
- **Feature**: Right-click on battlefield cards to remove them back to hand
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `_input` function with battlefield card detection
- **Function**: `move_card_back_to_hand` with complete state reset

### 6. **Comprehensive Visual Debugging** ✅
- **Cards**: Yellow borders on hover, scaling effects, detailed click logging
- **Enemies**: Green borders on hover, comprehensive input event logging
- **System**: Enhanced debugging throughout targeting workflow

## 🎮 COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### **Primary Targeting Workflow**
1. **Click Card in Hand** → Card selected with yellow border and pulse
2. **Click Enemy** → Target assigned + card automatically moves to battlefield
3. **Repeat** for multiple cards with different targets
4. **Click "End Turn"** → Cards execute with assigned targets

### **Advanced Battlefield Management**
1. **Click Battlefield Card** → Select card to change its target
2. **Click Enemy** → New target assigned to battlefield card
3. **Right-Click Battlefield Card** → Card returns to hand (target cleared)

### **Flexible Options**
- **Same Card Double-Click**: Move to battlefield without target (random target on execution)
